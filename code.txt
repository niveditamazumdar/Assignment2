This document analyses the Government Spending for North America
\end{abstract}
\section{Introduction}
\textbf{Government spending} refers to any expenditure made by local, regional, and national governments. In most countries, government spending makes up a significant portion of the GDP. Spending is accomplished in several major areas, including future investments, acquisitions, and transfer payments.Government spending or expenditure of country includes all government consumption, investment, and transfer payments.

Government spending or expenditure for a country is usually deeply scrutized.In general, the larger the government's deficit is, the less comfortable citizens feel about spending or investing money, so the economy tends to decline. The opposite also applies."Deficit" here refers to government funds used to reduce the difference between revenues and budget.

In this report we are comparing the government spending or expenditure for countries in North America i.e. \textbf{Canada,Mexico and United States of America}.Among all the North American countries, Canada is considered to be the freest economy.This means that Canada is most likely to survive and prosper in comparison to other countries during times of social and fiscal chaos.
Two decades ago Canada suffered a deep recession and teetered on the brink of a debt crisis caused by rising government spending but with cut in spending and balanced budget,Canadian economy boomed.
Mexico is ranked 3rd out of three countries in the North America region.Though Mexico's economy is rising,it was one of the Latin American nations most affected by the 2008 recession with its Gross Domestic Product contracting by more than 6\%.
USA is the 12th freeset country in the world.
\section{Result Section}
Below is the actual code executed to create the data table and the graph for our analysis.For this assignment, the required data has been fetched from Quandl as mentioned in the assignment.The assignment has 2 parts for analysis:
\begin{enumerate}
\item Analysis by change in Government Spending
\item Analysis by Level of Government Spending
\end{enumerate}
\subsection{Analysis by Change}
For this part, we fetched the data for the three North American countries namely Canada,Mexico and USA through Quandl API and put them into different data frames.These data frames were then merged in pairs to get the final data frame containing data for all the three countries.This is done using merge command.
Before starting with the code, it is necessary to install all the required packages.
<<>>=
library(XML)
library(ggplot2)
library(reshape2)
library(plyr)
library(Quandl)
@
\textbf{Get the tables on the page for analysis based on the change from Quandl.}
Read data for Canada from Quandl.For this we directly take the R code for dataset from Quandl and store it in a dataframe named "first" in R.Here the authcode is the unique userID for a user and \verb|"ODA/CAN_GGX"| is the code for the dataset in Quandl.Now since the dataset contains many rows,we will select only first 10 rows for analysis.The command head is used to display the table.The resulting table shows the data by change for government spending for Canada for 10 consecutive years.

<<>>=
first<-Quandl("ODA/CAN_GGX", trim_start="1980-12-31", trim_end="2019-12-31"
,transformation ="diff", authcode="K5uN_2KMV3bSt35DHxxM")
Canada<-first[1:10,]
head(Canada,10)
@

Similarly, we will read data for Mexico and USA from Quandl and store them in different dataframes.The resulting tables show the data by change for government spending for Mexico and USA.

<<>>=
second<-Quandl("ODA/MEX_GGX", trim_start="1990-12-31", trim_end="2019-12-31"
, transformation="diff", authcode="K5uN_2KMV3bSt35DHxxM")
Mexico<-second[1:10,]
head(Mexico,10)
@

<<>>=
third<-Quandl("ODA/USA_GGX", trim_start="1980-12-31", trim_end="2019-12-31"
, transformation="diff", authcode="K5uN_2KMV3bSt35DHxxM")
USA<-third[1:10,]
head(USA,10)
@
As of now we have 3 dataframes, each for every country in North America but this not what we want.We want a dataset containing data for all the three countries.To get the combined dataframe, we will merge these dataframes 2 at a time to get the final dataset using merge command.
Here merging Canada and Mexico to get Merge1 using merge command.The command for merge contains "by" parameter which contains the field used to match both the dataframes.Here this parameter is "Date" which is a common field in Canada and Mexico.

<<>>=
merge1<-merge(x=Canada,y=Mexico,by=c("Date"))
head(merge1)
@
Similarly,here merging Mexico and USA to get Merge2.Same as merge1,"by" parameter is "Date" which is a common field in Mexico and USA.  
<<>>=
merge2<-merge(x=Mexico,y=USA,by=c("Date"))
head(merge2)
@

Finally merging Merge1 and Merge2 to get a dataframe finalmerge containing data for North American countries.
<<>>=
finalmerge<-merge(x=merge1,y=merge2,by=c("Date"))
head(finalmerge)
@
In the above displayed table we have four columns,one for Canada and USA each and two for Mexico.Hence we need to remove this extra unwanted column for Mexico.To do this we will use \verb|as.data.frame()| command to remove the extra column(here it is 4th column).
To refine the final table,we rename the columns for the final dataframe using rename command.For the rename command,install plyr package before using it.

<<>>=
finalmerge<-rename(finalmerge,c("Value.x.x"="Canada","Value.y.x"="Mexico",
"Value.y.y"="USA"))
finalmerge<-as.data.frame(finalmerge[,-4])
head(finalmerge,10)
@
Now we create a new data frame df with the contents of finalmerge.Then df is replaced with the contents of Canada,Mexico and USA.For creating a graph we need our dataframe in long format but since current format of our dataframe is wide, we use melt function to convert wide format to long format.Since we donot want Date field in long format, hence we use id.vars="Date".
<<>>=
df<-data.frame(finalmerge)
df.m<-melt(df,id.vars=c("Date"))
df<-data.frame(Canada,Mexico,USA)
@
Creating a bargraph to analyse the level of Government spending for North America using ggplot.Here we are using \verb|position=position_dodge()| to display a bar for each country for the respective year.Here we have date on x-axis, value for change on y-axis and color for the bar outline.
gglot2 package is required for creating a bar graph using ggplot.
<<fig=TRUE>>=
ggplot(df.m,aes(x=Date,y=value,fill=variable))+geom_bar(stat="identity"
,position=position_dodge(),color="black")+
ggtitle( "Figure1:Graph showing analysis by Change")
@
Figure1. shows a graph for government spending by change.The change in government spending for every country is not linear, for some years there is a decrease and for other years there is an increase in the government spending.For the year 2010 where there was a positive change or increase in the government spending for Canada and Mexico,USA had a negative change or decrease in the expenditure.This was the year of recession.
\subsection{Analysis by Level}
For the second part,we fetched the data from Quandl API for the countries and cleaned it to get the desired dataset.Similar steps are followed as mentioned in the part for analysis by change. 

Get the table on the page for analysis based on the level in government spending.We have downloaded the csv file from Quandl API and then importing it into R using read command.
<<>>=
bylevel<-read.csv(file="multisets.csv")
bylevel<-rename(bylevel,c("ODA.USA_GGX...Value"="USA",
 "ODA.CAN_GGX...Value"="Canada","ODA.MEX_GGX...Value"="Mexico"))
@

Cleaning the data to get only the first 10 rows for the table.Same steps are followed as followed for analysis by change.
<<>>=
bylevel<-as.data.frame(bylevel[1:10,])
head(bylevel,10)
bylevel.new<-data.frame(bylevel)
bylevel.m<-melt(bylevel.new)
@

Creating a bargraph to analyse the change in Government spending for North America using ggplot same as mentioned in analysis by change.
<<fig=TRUE>>=
ggplot(bylevel.m, aes(x=Date, y=value,fill=variable)) +geom_bar(stat="identity"
,position=position_dodge(),color="black")+
  ggtitle( "Figure2:Graph showing analysis by level")
@

Figure2. shows a graph for Government spending by Level.It shows the difference in the level of spending by the government of a particular country.As Indicated by the graph, the level of expenditure has increased for every country over the years.However,the government spending for Canada is much less compared to the other two countries.While the level of expenditure for Canada is in the range of 800 for the year 2014, USA and Mexico has it in the range more than 2000.


\section{Data Section}
Although we have explored the data in the code section, this section specifically explores every dataset used.Exploring data means to identify or viewing the internal structure of the data set.
\begin{itemize}
\item str() shows the number of variables,name of the variables,number of records and other details about the dataframe.
\item summary() gives a summary of the dataframe.It shows the minimum and maximum value for every column or variable in the dataframe,the median etc..
\item class() gives the data type of the variable, whether it is a dataframe or a number or a character.
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Analysis by Change}
For the first part i.e. Analysis by change, we have 3 data frames for each country and a final data frame containing the desired data.
<<>>=
str(Canada)
summary(Canada)
class(Canada)


str(Mexico)
summary(Mexico)
class(Mexico)


str(USA)
summary(USA)
class(USA)


str(finalmerge)
summary(finalmerge)
class(finalmerge)

@

\subsection{Analysis by Level}
For the second part, we are executing the same functions only on one variable i.e. on bylevel.
<<>>=
str(bylevel)
summary(bylevel)
class(bylevel)
